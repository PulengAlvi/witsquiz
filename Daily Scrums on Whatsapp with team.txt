Please choose 5 (there are 18) and send through your lists today🙏🏾
2023/03/06, 11:33 - Thapelo Duma: By today please, the earlier we submit, the better our chances and we don't have to worry about making a list again
2023/03/06, 11:33 - Thapelo Duma: You can send your list of 5 here and we'll see which ones we take

17. Appointment booking system
18. Quiz platform
2023/03/06, 12:34 - Faith 🦄 SD: Please guys, let's choose things that are easy to build. Otherwise we will not get enough marks and this is the 1 course where we actually can get 90s

2023/03/06, 13:13 - Faith 🦄 SD: He is the most difficult client to have. If possible, we want to have a student as a client
2023/03/06, 13:19 - Thapelo Duma: Noted👍🏾

Since they were on everyone's list. Another fair addition because it's on 4 lists is

Another addition on 3 lists is

2023/03/06, 15:04 - Puleng: 14 should be the last one
2023/03/06, 15:06 - Thapelo Duma: Why do you say so?
2023/03/06, 15:06 - Puleng: I think we should decide on the order coz my list was not in order
2023/03/06, 15:07 - Thapelo Duma: I mean you can put it in order but I'm basing it off votes
4 people had no.14 on their list so they don't seem to mind doing it
2023/03/06, 15:08 - Puleng: So it's based on which one got many votes?
2023/03/06, 15:09 - Thapelo Duma: Yeah
2023/03/06, 15:09 - Thapelo Duma: Or do you guys think we should order them?
2023/03/06, 15:09 - Thapelo Duma: If you're fine with yours, send a 👍🏾 and if not, send a 👎🏾
2023/03/06, 15:11 - Puleng: So guys out of:

2023/03/06, 15:11 - Puleng: Please send them back in your order or preferences
2023/03/06, 15:25 - Neo SD: I'm fine with this list tbh
2023/03/06, 15:43 - Thapelo Duma: This is the original list I went for
2023/03/06, 15:43 - Thapelo Duma: If anyone has a different order, please send it through
2023/03/06, 22:24 - Faith 🦄 SD: So guys are we absolutely sure that we can do any of the 5 if given? I'm asking because we are most likely to be assigned according to what everyone chooses. If nobody chose 5B but us, we are most likely getting 5B.
If everyone chose 15, chances are; it's going to be a raffle
2023/03/06, 22:24 - Faith 🦄 SD: I'm happy with the order
2023/03/07, 06:46 - Thapelo Duma: Hey guys, can @27727342498 @27712636997 @27720531936 please send their preferred list or just say you're fine with the one we have so we can submit it
2023/03/07, 07:29 - Moloko: Hi ,I'm also happy with @27712636997 's list ✊🏾
2023/03/07, 08:17 - Puleng: 18
17
14
15
5B
2023/03/07, 08:27 - Puleng: 18,17,14 are gonna be a lil harder to do since we gonna need to implement local storage management or our app would be slower as we add more features throughout the sprint...
2023/03/07, 08:30 - Puleng: Actually 15 not 17
2023/03/07, 08:30 - Puleng: So overall the easiest are gonna be 17,5B
2023/03/07, 08:33 - Puleng: So if you wanna get easy 90% we'd put 17 and 5B first but if we wanna have fun and take risks😅 18,15,14 are our best bet
2023/03/07, 08:36 - Thapelo Duma: @27727342498 please let us know
2023/03/07, 08:38 - Thapelo Duma: If that's how you see it, that's fair. That's why I need everyone to send their lists so we can see how everyone is feeling
2023/03/07, 09:52 - Okuhle SD: Im also fine with the list
2023/03/07, 09:56 - Thapelo Duma: So the only change here is the order of 18 and 15
Ayt we'll use this one
2023/03/07, 09:57 - Thapelo Duma: Since we're all fine with @27712636997's list, I'll submit that
2023/03/10, 13:17 - Puleng: So we got project 18😅
2023/03/10, 13:18 - Puleng: @27814922716  so you can set our sprint planning on Monday
2023/03/10, 13:55 - Thapelo Duma: Ayt so we got the Quiz Platform
I'll send our client an email and see when they want to meet
2023/03/10, 18:17 - Thapelo Duma: I'll tell him that🤝🏾
And we'll make a discord server to make communication easier
2023/03/10, 18:37 - Thapelo Duma: https://discord.gg/v9AHsVKf
2023/03/10, 20:47 - Thapelo Duma: Hey guys please join the discord server so we can communicate with our client
2023/03/10, 20:47 - Thapelo Duma: He's a tutor so he says he'll see us before the lab
2023/03/10, 20:49 - Puleng: So it's not gonna be online?
2023/03/10, 20:50 - Thapelo Duma: Well, it's assuming we're there live
If it is online, we'll do a team's meeting before the lab
2023/03/10, 20:50 - Puleng: Thought you'd set the meeting to be on Google meet🙃
2023/03/10, 20:51 - Thapelo Duma: Nah
2023/03/10, 20:51 - Thapelo Duma: When I emailed him, he suggested Teams
2023/03/10, 20:51 - Thapelo Duma: Also please join the discord if you haven't so we can all communicate there
2023/03/10, 20:51 - Puleng: Ohh so it's gonna be online, that's better
2023/03/10, 20:51 - Puleng: Will do
2023/03/10, 20:52 - Thapelo Duma: You don't want to go physically?😂
2023/03/10, 20:53 - Puleng: 😂😂 uhmm I got COVID, so that's my excuse for noe
2023/03/10, 20:55 - Puleng: So who's gonna be taking notes during our meeting with the client?
2023/03/10, 21:18 - Thapelo Duma: I'll be taking the notes
But you guys can also take notes if you want. Maybe you hear something that you already have an answer to🤷🏾‍♂️

I will not be able to make it to the meeting with the client today. I am really not feeling well, but I am going to the Doctor.

Pretty please let me know how it goes
2023/03/13, 10:17 - Moloko: Cxxl,no problem 👍🏿 ....hope you get better
2023/03/13, 10:18 - Moloko: Hi guys ,can anyone doing ML dm me pls

2023/03/13, 13:27 - Thapelo Duma: I'm there
2023/03/13, 13:30 - Neo SD: Same
2023/03/13, 13:31 - Thapelo Duma: What are y'all dressed like
2023/03/13, 13:32 - Thapelo Duma: I have a white shirt and bucket hat
2023/03/13, 13:32 - Okuhle SD: Yes we can see you
2023/03/13, 13:34 - Thapelo Duma: Where are you?
2023/03/13, 14:10 - Thapelo Duma: <Media omitted>
2023/03/13, 22:40 - Thapelo Duma: Hey guys, sorry to type this late.
Mainly for the ones who couldn't make it, for this first sprint, we need to create 3 pages. The Login, Sign Up and HomePage. Since we are doing a quiz platform, we need a database (Firebase) which is good enough to handle photos as there will be questions with photos.
There will be a leader board at the end of the quiz showing who got the highest.
 *Forgot Password* and *Email verification* are two additional user-stories that we can add.
We need to split this sprint to allow for everyone to have a part in this and also we will be using *React* as our platform, which uses Javascript. Please familiarize yourselves with it if you don't know it
2023/03/14, 17:25 - Thapelo Duma: Hey guys, please download/install these if you haven't already:
- React
- Github
- Circle CI
- Taiga
- Webstorm
2023/03/14, 17:27 - Thapelo Duma: I hope you're all well
We also need to decide who will do the sign up page, login page and homepage.
These pages also need background info (database access and control) so that's how we can split it. One does the page in front-end while the other one does the back-end
2023/03/14, 17:42 - Faith 🦄 SD: Hi guys I can do the login, front end. I'd of course need to work with someone and wait for the sign up guys
2023/03/14, 18:02 - Moloko: Hi guys...

Are we working in pairs(front end and back end ) ....can’t we meet after the SD lecture tomorrow to discuss ..
If not , I can do the sign up page if that’s okay with yall !
2023/03/14, 20:11 - Thapelo Duma: Yeah let's meet tomorrow after SD.
2023/03/14, 20:14 - Faith 🦄 SD: That's if it isn't online
2023/03/14, 20:17 - Thapelo Duma: Yeah true, but for now

Login: Faith
Sign Up: Moloko
2023/03/15, 09:26 - Neo SD: Hi guys I'll be slightly late for the meeting today
2023/03/15, 09:41 - Thapelo Duma: We'll be by the benches outside MPT
2023/03/15, 09:41 - Puleng: Lecture is done?
2023/03/15, 09:45 - Thapelo Duma: Yeah it's done
2023/03/15, 09:57 - Neo SD: This message was deleted
2023/03/15, 10:00 - Puleng: Are you still on your way?

2023/03/17, 15:46 - Okuhle SD: Hey guys can I get your emails so I can add you on taiga
2023/03/17, 17:40 - Thapelo Duma: 2493083@students.wits.ac.za
2023/03/17, 17:45 - Neo SD: Thanks
2023/03/17, 17:45 - Neo SD: 2428953@students.wits.ac.za
2023/03/17, 17:58 - Moloko: 2454413@
2023/03/18, 14:08 - Okuhle SD: I also sent you invitations on creately so when we draw UML diagrams we can all see them
2023/03/18, 19:11 - Thapelo Duma: Thank you very much
2023/03/20, 10:09 - Thapelo Duma: Hey guys, so for React, you can search for 'React Native' on your browser and install it into your Android Studio and use it from there

Also, 'React' is used on the browser for the web access part so we'll see how far we need to go there
2023/03/20, 15:04 - Puleng: @27744554559  what's your username on GitHub?
2023/03/20, 20:48 - Puleng: So guys we don't do daily scrum meetings in this group?😅
2023/03/20, 21:09 - Faith 🦄 SD: khatji
2023/03/20, 21:09 - Faith 🦄 SD: We should be
2023/03/20, 21:54 - Thapelo Duma: You right we should be
Seeing as though meeting in person is rather problematic, we can do it online(especially when we don't have class)
So how about tomorrow at 14h00?
2023/03/20, 21:54 - Thapelo Duma: Then Wednesday we can meet up after the SD lecture?
2023/03/20, 22:01 - Okuhle SD: Yes 2 is fine tomorrow
2023/03/20, 22:27 - Faith 🦄 SD: So guys, how daily scrum works is that everyday we are supposed to make progress on the development and report to each other on either Discord or Whatsapp. When they mark they are going to want to see proof of Daily Scrums and its going to be worth like 15 marks according to last year's rubrik
2023/03/20, 22:50 - Thapelo Duma: So we have our meetings via messages here on the group?
2023/03/20, 22:57 - Faith 🦄 SD: Yes
2023/03/20, 22:58 - Faith 🦄 SD: Like"Hi guys, today I completed 1 and 2, I am stuck on this and that, I need help.... Tomorrow I will do... "

Every single day, every one of us
2023/03/21, 00:55 - Thapelo Duma: Alright thanks for that🙏🏾 much appreciated
2023/03/21, 00:55 - Thapelo Duma: So we can all meet at 14h00 and write what we have completed and what needs to be done (things of that nature)
2023/03/21, 07:02 - Faith 🦄 SD: Alright. May we please meet virtually? I don't stay nearby and I would have to drive to Campus
2023/03/21, 07:07 - Faith 🦄 SD: So, as the Scrum Master you have to make sure we abide by the Scrum methodology basically, instead of the Group Leader, you basically are the "Mom".

So we need to do the retro, sprint planning, Daily Scrums...

And that's literally all you have to do. If we don't have those meetings and their minutes then you will not have done literally the 1 job you have to do.
A solution for missed meetings = fabricating minutes for each day we missed and that will be your job 1 day before marking, and it's not a great job.
2023/03/21, 09:58 - Thapelo Duma: Yeah we're meeting virtually today, but here on Whatsapp to basically record what we've done
2023/03/21, 09:58 - Thapelo Duma: 🙏🏾
2023/03/21, 13:39 - Faith 🦄 SD: Hey, where are we meeting?
2023/03/21, 13:42 - Thapelo Duma: Must we host an online meeting or should we just write our progress here on Whatsapp
2023/03/21, 13:42 - Thapelo Duma: Because we can do a voice call here as well
2023/03/21, 13:58 - Thapelo Duma: I'll start a group call here on Whatsapp
2023/03/21, 13:59 - Faith 🦄 SD: More than happy to type
2023/03/21, 13:59 - Thapelo Duma: No problem, you can just join the call if you have something you want to say
2023/03/21, 13:59 - Thapelo Duma: I'll just say what we spoke about the other time, and how far we are
2023/03/21, 14:00 - You started a call
2023/03/21, 14:04 - Faith 🦄 SD: @27784901179

Let's please talk privately. Hopefully we can meet after class tomorrow and do the login.

Those who are doing sign up, please do share the design?

2023/03/21, 14:20 - Thapelo Duma: Maybe try fetching the zip file from Github and see how you can change that from React to React Native
But maybe you for you can just show what you've done so far and then we'll find a way to upload it onto the Github account
2023/03/21, 14:23 - Puleng: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpPqplz6dKxW5ZfERUPoYTtNUNvrEebAR
2023/03/21, 14:24 - Puleng: I'll be using this playlist and it has a firebase web app example
2023/03/21, 14:29 - Thapelo Duma: Thank you🙏🏾
2023/03/21, 14:34 - Puleng: So go to GitHub, download the react project as a zip file, unzip it, open the folder with VS code, it won't run because it has no (node modules), so you open the terminal on VS code, type "npm install", then when it's done you can type "npm start" to run the web app, you'll see "witsquiz" as a header on your browser
2023/03/21, 14:35 - Puleng: It's important you do this to avoid adding errors to our project
2023/03/21, 14:35 - Puleng: https://youtu.be/Rs2BT6HrwMw
2023/03/21, 14:36 - Puleng: Use this if you don't know how to install react or running react with vs code
2023/03/21, 19:38 - Thapelo Duma: @27712636997 what are you saying here?
